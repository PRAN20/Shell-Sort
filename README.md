# Shell-Sort

Shell sort is an algorithm that first sorts the elements far apart from each other and successively reduces the interval between the elements to be sorted. It is a generalized version of insertion sort. In shell sort, elements at a specific interval are sorted. The interval between the elements is gradually decreased based on the sequence used.
